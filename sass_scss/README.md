# Sass & SCSS

## What is Sass?

Sass (Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets) is a preprocessor scripting language that enhances the capabilities of traditional CSS. It provides a more organized and efficient way to write styles for web pages.

## Writing Sass & SCSS Files

Sass files use the `.sass` extension, while SCSS (Sassy CSS) files use the `.scss` extension. SCSS is a superset of CSS, making it more familiar for developers transitioning from plain CSS.

## Difference between Sass and SCSS

The key difference between Sass and SCSS is the syntax. Sass uses indentation-based syntax with no curly braces, while SCSS uses a more traditional CSS-like syntax with curly braces and semicolons.

## Sass Preprocessing

Sass files need to be compiled into standard CSS before they can be used in web pages. This is done using a Sass compiler, which translates Sass/SCSS code into plain CSS.

## Declaring Variables

```
$primary-color: #007bff;
$font-size: 16px;

.selector {
  color: $primary-color;
  font-size: $font-size;
}
```
